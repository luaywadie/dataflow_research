# Dataflow Research Project Components
This project will establish the guidelines and understanding of a scientific workflow from research.

<ins>Research Progress</ins>
- Core Definitions and Theorems
  - [Objective Definitions](https://github.com/luaywadie/dataflow_research/blob/master/lexicon/core_definitions.md) ⟲
  - [ANTLR4 Definitions](https://github.com/luaywadie/dataflow_research/blob/master/lexicon/antlr4_definitions.md) ⟲
- [Initial Setup](https://github.com/luaywadie/dataflow_research/tree/master/builds/initial_phase) ✔
  - Constructed the basic demo files and fully configured (Linux | Windows 10) environments for future operations.
  - Installed DATAVIEW Java API and instantiated the initial test files using Eclipse.
- [Arithmetic (Basic)](https://github.com/luaywadie/dataflow_research/tree/master/builds/arithmetic) ✔
  - Creating a simple input recognizer for digits and variables ✔
  - Inline support for functions and methods (Semantic) ✔
  - Semantic PEMDAS Support ❗
- [Parse Tree Listener](https://github.com/luaywadie/dataflow_research/tree/master/builds/parse_tree_listener) ⟲
  - Create a walker that traverses over the identified nodes ⟲
- [Workflow System (Celestial Bodies Example)](https://github.com/luaywadie/dataflow_research/tree/master/NBody) ⟲
  - Iteration 0 to update bodies based on Position, Velocity and Mass. ✔
  - Continuous iterations based on time steps. ⟲
